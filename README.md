# Cluster-Forge

**A helper tool that sets up all essential platform tools to prepare a Kubernetes cluster for running applications.**

## Overview

**Cluster-Forge** is a tool designed to bundle various third-party, community, and in-house components into a single, streamlined stack that can be deployed in Kubernetes clusters. By automating the deployment process, Cluster-Forge simplifies the creation of consistent, ready-to-use clusters.

This tool is ideal for scenarios such as:

- **Ephemeral test clusters** - Create temporary environments quickly
- **CI/CD pipeline clusters** - Ensure consistent testing environments
- **Multiple production clusters** - Manage a fleet of clusters efficiently
- **Reproducible environments** - Ensure consistency across deployments

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Using a pre-built stack (recommended for first-time users)
# 1. Download a release package
# 2. Extract the package
# 3. Deploy to your Kubernetes cluster
./deploy.sh

# Building your own stack with devbox
devbox shell
go run . forge  # Runs both smelt and cast, creating an ephemeral image
```

## üìã Workflow

Cluster-Forge operates through a sequence of well-defined steps:

1. **Mine** - Process input configuration to generate normalized YAML in the input directory
2. **Smelt** - Process input configuration to generate normalized YAML in the working directory
3. **Customize** (optional) - Edit files in the working directory
4. **Cast** - Compile components into a deployable stack image
5. **Forge** - Combined operation that runs both smelt and cast, creating an ephemeral image

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **[Devbox](docs/DEVBOX.md)** for development environment
- **Docker** with multi-architecture support (buildx)
- **Golang** v1.23+
- **kubectl**
- **Helm**

Setting up the development environment:

```bash
# Install devbox
curl -fsSL https://get.jetpack.io/devbox | bash

# Start devbox shell
devbox shell
```

### Common Commands

```bash
# Building
go build
just build

# Running commands
go run . mine
go run . smelt
go run . cast
go run . forge

# With debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=debug go run . smelt
LOG_LEVEL=debug go run . cast
LOG_LEVEL=debug go run . forge

# Shorthand with justfile
just debug-smelt
just debug-cast
just debug-forge

# Testing
go test ./...

# Cleanup
devbox run clean
just clean-all

# Reset Kind cluster (for testing)
devbox run resetKind
```

## üìÑ Configuration

The project uses YAML configuration files:

- Main configuration: `input/config.yaml`
- Default options: `options/defaults.yaml`
- Release configurations: `input/config-*.yaml`
- Source configurations: `input/*/source.yaml`

## üó∫Ô∏è Development Roadmap

Cluster-Forge development is managed using [TaskMaster AI](https://github.com/taskmaster-ai/taskmaster-ai) for structured project management. The complete roadmap and task details can be found in [PRD.md](PRD.md).

### Current Development Priorities

#### üî¥ High Priority
1. **Enhanced Testing Framework** - Comprehensive unit, integration, E2E, and performance testing
2. **Improved Error Handling** - Standardized error types, recovery mechanisms, troubleshooting guides
3. **Configuration Validation** - Schema validation, dependency conflict detection, compatibility checks

#### üü° Medium Priority
4. **Performance Optimization** - Parallel processing, incremental builds, caching, resource monitoring
5. **Enhanced Customization** - Templating system, environment injection, plugin architecture
6. **Observability Improvements** - Logging, metrics, deployment tracking, health monitoring, audit trails

#### üü¢ Low Priority
7. **Additional Integrations** - Multiple Helm repos, CI/CD platforms, GitOps tools, cloud optimizations
8. **Documentation & Examples** - Configuration guides, best practices, tutorials, contribution guidelines

### Task Management

For contributors and maintainers, use TaskMaster to track development progress:

```bash
# View all tasks
tm get-tasks

# Get next task to work on
tm next-task

# Update task status
tm set-task-status <task-id> <status>
```

## üêû Known Issues

Cluster-Forge is still a work in progress with the following known issues:
