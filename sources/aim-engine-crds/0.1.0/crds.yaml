          AIMClusterModel is a cluster-scoped model catalog entry for AIM container images.

          Cluster-scoped models can be referenced by AIMServices in any namespace, making them ideal for
          shared model deployments across teams and projects. Like namespace-scoped AIMModels, cluster models
          trigger discovery jobs to extract metadata and generate service templates.

          When both cluster and namespace models exist for the same container image, services will preferentially
          use the namespace-scoped AIMModel when referenced by image URI.

                  Filters define which images to discover and sync.
                  Each filter specifies an image pattern with optional version constraints and exclusions.

                    ModelSourceFilter defines a pattern for discovering images.
                    Supports multiple formats:
                    - Repository patterns: "org/repo*" - matches repositories with wildcards
                    - Repository with tag: "org/repo:1.0.0" - exact tag match
                    - Full URI: "ghcr.io/org/repo:1.0.0" - overrides registry and tag

                        Exclude lists specific repository names to skip (exact match on repository name only, not registry).
                        Useful for excluding base images or experimental versions.

                        Examples:
                        - ["amdenterpriseai/aim-base", "amdenterpriseai/aim-experimental"]
                        - ["silogen/aim-base"] - works with "ghcr.io/silogen/aim-*" (registry is not checked in exclusion)

                        Note: Exclusions match against repository names (e.g., "silogen/aim-base"), not full URIs.

                        Supported formats:
                        - Repository pattern: "amdenterpriseai/aim-*"
                        - Repository with tag: "silogen/aim-llama:1.0.0" (overrides versions field)
                        - Full URI: "ghcr.io/silogen/aim-google-gemma-3-1b-it:0.8.1-rc1" (overrides spec.registry and versions)
                        - Full URI with wildcard: "ghcr.io/silogen/aim-*" (overrides spec.registry)

                        When a full URI is specified (including registry like ghcr.io), only images from that
                        registry will match. When a tag is included, it takes precedence over the versions field.

                        Wildcard: * matches any sequence of characters.

                        Only tags that parse as valid semver are considered (including prereleases like 0.8.1-rc1).
                        Ignored if the Image field includes an explicit tag (e.g., "repo:1.0.0").

                        Examples: ">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0", "~1.2.0" (patch updates), "^1.0.0" (minor updates)

                        Prerelease versions (e.g., 0.8.1-rc1) are supported and follow semver rules:
                        - 0.8.1-rc1 matches ">=0.8.0" (prerelease is part of version 0.8.1)
                        - Use ">=0.8.1-rc1" to match only that prerelease or higher

                  Versions specifies global semantic version constraints applied to all filters.
                  Individual filters can override this with their own version constraints.
                  Constraints use semver syntax: >=1.0.0, <2.0.0, ~1.2.0, ^1.0.0, etc.
                  Non-semver tags (e.g., "latest", "dev") are silently skipped.

                  Version ranges work on all registries (including ghcr.io, gcr.io) when combined with
                  exact repository names (no wildcards). The controller uses the Tags List API to fetch
                  all tags for the repository and filters them by the semver constraint.

                  Example: registry=ghcr.io, filters=[{image: "silogen/aim-llama"}], versions=[">=1.0.0"]
                  will fetch all tags from ghcr.io/silogen/aim-llama and include only those >=1.0.0.

          model creation scope, and routing configuration.

          When both cluster and namespace runtime configs exist with the same name, the configs are merged, and

                          Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                          boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                          allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                          Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                          generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                          routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                          any namespace to the Service.

                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                          "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                          connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                          the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                          ParentRef of the Route.

                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners

                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                          and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                          must match both specified values.

                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment

                      The template is rendered against the AIMService object to generate unique paths.

                      Example templates:

                      - Use valid JSONPath expressions wrapped in {...}
                      - Reference fields that exist on the service

          AIMClusterServiceTemplate is a cluster-scoped template that defines runtime profiles for AIM services.

          Cluster-scoped templates can be used by AIMServices in any namespace, making them ideal for
          platform-wide model configurations that should be shared across teams and projects.
          Unlike namespace-scoped AIMServiceTemplates, cluster templates do not support caching configuration
          and must be managed by cluster administrators, since caches themselves are namespace-scoped.

          When both cluster and namespace templates exist with the same name, the namespace-scoped template
          takes precedence for services in that namespace.

                          "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                          connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                          the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a

                    description: |-
                      PathTemplate defines the HTTP path template for routes, evaluated using JSONPath expressions.
                      The template is rendered against the AIMService object to generate unique paths.

                      Example templates:
                      - `/{.metadata.namespace}/{.metadata.name}` - namespace and service name
                      - `/{.metadata.namespace}/{.metadata.labels['team']}/inference` - with label
                      - `/models/{.spec.aimModelName}` - based on model name

                      The template must:
                      - Use valid JSONPath expressions wrapped in {...}
                      - Reference fields that exist on the service
                      - Produce a path ≤ 200 characters after rendering
                      - Result in valid URL path segments (lowercase, RFC 1123 compliant)

                      If evaluation fails, the service enters Degraded state with PathTemplateInvalid reason.
                      Individual services can override this template via spec.routing.pathTemplate.

              A namespaced and versioned template that selects a runtime profile
              for a given AIM model (by canonical name). Templates are intentionally
              narrow: they describe runtime selection knobs for the AIM container and do
              not redefine the full Kubernetes deployment shape.
